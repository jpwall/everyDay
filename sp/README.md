# Day 3:
## sp

Short for StockPortfolio, this shell script enables me to run my portfolio project with one simple command instead of running it through gradle every time.

This program has reached a point of development that I am satisfied with, so I figured I would compile it into a jar file and enable the ability to run it globally anytime, anywhere rather than having to cd into the directory all the time which was a PAIN.

It is used as follows and only really works on my system (sorry): `./sp.sh 'args'`
