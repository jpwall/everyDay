# javax

This small program runs `javac` for a given file then `java` for the compiled class. It currently does not support absolute file paths, only relative.

The command and arguments are as follows: `./javax.sh [.java file without .java ending]`

Your program will proceed to compile and then run in the terminal! Created on and intended for use in FreeBSD.
