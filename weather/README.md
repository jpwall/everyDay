# Day 4
## weather

Small program that I wrote to give weather information for a specific set of latitude and longitude coordinates.

It is run through node by running `node app.js` and the specific locations for weather are determined by the function calls inside of `app.js`.

I currently have it set up so that it gives me the weather of Portland and Seattle using the OpenWeatherMap API.
